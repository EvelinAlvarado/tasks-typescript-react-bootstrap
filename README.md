## Description

**Taskly** is a project developed to start my journey with TypeScript and Bootstrap. It is a task management application where you can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 

Throughout this project, I have learned:
- How to integrate TypeScript with React for type safety.
- How to use Bootstrap for responsive and modern UI design.
- How to manage state in a React application and handle user interactions.

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with TypeScript and Bootstrap by building a functional task management application.

## Key Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a title and description.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or pending.
